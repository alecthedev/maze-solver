# Hexagonal Maze Generator and Solver

Project for the Boot.dev maze generator course. The initial project was to make a maze based on square cells in a grid, but I decided to make things a little more interesting and base the maze on hexagonal tiles. This program was written in Python and uses the Tkinter module.
